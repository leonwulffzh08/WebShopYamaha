            <p>Yamaha's sports bikes stand for maximum performance, precise handling and racing feeling at the highest level. The models are aerodynamically designed, have powerful engines and state-of-the-art riding assistance systems - ideal for ambitious riders.

              The R-series is particularly well-known, for example with the YZF-R125, YZF-R7 or the flagship YZF-R1, which are visually and technically strongly orientated towards the machines from MotoGP.
              
              These motorbikes are built for speed, tight bends and an intense experience on the road or race track.
              
              Anyone looking for adrenalin, technology and sporty design in one bike is guaranteed to find what they are looking for with Yamaha's sports bikes.</p>

            <p>Yamaha naked bikes combine purist design with impressive performance. Without panelling and with visible technology, they stand for a raw, authentic riding style where the focus is entirely on the riding experience.

                Yamaha's MT series - including models such as the MT-07 or MT-09 - is particularly popular and is known for its powerful torque, agility in city traffic and sporty dynamics.
                
                Thanks to their low weight and upright riding position, naked bikes offer a direct, unadulterated riding experience and are suitable for both everyday use and extended tours.
                
                Anyone looking for a motorbike that combines performance, style and suitability for everyday use will find Yamaha's naked bikes a convincing choice.</p>

              <p>Yamaha enduro bikes are made for anyone who wants to ride off-road - whether on gravel tracks, forest trails or rough terrain.

                With robust technology, high ground clearance and a well-balanced chassis, they offer exactly the characteristics you need off-road: control, stability and reliability.
                
                Models such as the WR series or the popular Tenere 700 show that Yamaha also sets standards in the off-road sector. They combine off-road capability with suitability for everyday use - ideal for adventure-seekers who don't want to compromise.
                
                If you are looking for an all-rounder that is convincing both on long tours and off-road, you will definitely find what you are looking for in Yamaha's enduro bikes.</p>
